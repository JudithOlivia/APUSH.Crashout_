        <h2>I. The Rise of Political Democracy</h2>
        <h3>The "Revolution of 1800": Thomas Jefferson's election</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First peaceful transfer of power between rival political parties (Federalists to Democratic-Republicans)</li>
            <li>Proved the Constitution and the republic could survive</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Jefferson's Presidency (1801-1809):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Agrarian republic, "wise and frugal government," strict constructionism</li>
            <li><strong>Contradictions:</strong> Maintained many Federalist programs (Bank of the U.S.), and his Louisiana Purchase (1803) used implied powers (a loose constructionist argument!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Expansion of the Franchise (Voting Rights):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By the 1820s-1830s, most states eliminated property requirements for white male voters</li>
            <li>Rise of universal white male suffrage – the "common man" became a powerful political force</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Second Party System (Jacksonian Era):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Democrats (Andrew Jackson):</strong> Favored limited government, states' rights, and the "common man." Suspicious of banks and modernization</li>
            <li><strong>Whigs (Henry Clay):</strong> Favored a strong federal government, the American System, and industrial/commercial development</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>II. The Development of an American Culture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hudson River School:</strong> First coherent American art movement, focused on majestic American landscapes</li>
            <li><strong>Transcendentalism (Romanticism):</strong> Emphasized individualism, emotion, and intuition over reason
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> Ralph Waldo Emerson ("Self-Reliance"), Henry David Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Utopian Communities:</strong> Brook Farm, Oneida, Shakers – experimental communities seeking perfect societies</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>III. Social & Political Reform Movements</h2>
        <p>Driven by the Second Great Awakening and democratic ideals</p>
            
        <ul>

                    <li><strong>Immediatists (William Lloyd Garrison):</strong> Demanded immediate, uncompensated emancipation. Published The Liberator</li>
                    <li><strong>Black Abolitionists:</strong> Frederick Douglass (powerful orator and writer), David Walker, Sojourner Truth</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Women's Rights:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cult of Domesticity:</strong> Prevailing ideal that women's role was in the home as moral guardians</li>
                    <li><strong>Seneca Falls Convention (1848):</strong> Organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott. Issued the "Declaration of Sentiments" modeled on the Declaration of Independence, demanding equal rights for women, including suffrage</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>I. The Market Revolution</h2>
        <p>A major shift from a subsistence economy to a market-based economy connected by transportation and communication networks</p>

            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Telegraph (Samuel Morse)</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Cotton Gin (Eli Whitney) → made cotton highly profitable, revitalizing Southern slavery</li>
            <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Interchangeable parts (Whitney again), factory system (Lowell System)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Effects:</h3>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Growth of Cities:</strong> Urban centers swelled, especially in the North</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>II. The Age of Jackson (1829-1837)</h2>
        <p>Jacksonian Democracy: Champion of the "common man," but strongly pro-slavery and anti-Native American</p>
            
        <h3>Key Policies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spoils System:</strong> Rewarding political supporters with government jobs</li>
            <li><strong>Indian Removal Act (1830):</strong> Forced relocation of Native American tribes (Cherokee, Creek, etc.) west of the Mississippi River. Trail of Tears (1838) was the deadly consequence</li>
            <li><strong>Nullification Crisis (1832-1833):</strong> South Carolina declared a federal tariff "null and void." Jackson threatened force, upholding federal power. Crisis highlighted growing sectional tensions over states' rights</li>
            <li><strong>Bank War:</strong> Jackson vetoed the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, believing it was a corrupt monopoly that favored the elite. He "killed" the bank by moving federal funds to state "pet banks," contributing to the Panic of 1837</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 4.3:</strong> The U.S. interest in increasing foreign trade and expanding its national borders shaped the nation's foreign policy and spurred government and private initiatives.

            <li><strong>Mexican-American War (1846-1848):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Border dispute (Rio Grande vs. Nueces River) and U.S. desire for Mexican land</li>

                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> U.S. victory. Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo gave U.S. the Mexican Cession (CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO)</li>
