**Features:**

## Why I Made This Project
A lot of my friends struggle with this course and as someone who has taken this course previously and wants to help them, I find it overwealming to teach every single one of my friends about the topics and repeat myself 6 to 7 times. I initially made a google document with all the info but my friend recommended that I make a website out of it and I did.

## How I Made This Project
I used HTML and CSS

### Challenges

   - **Problem**: Making the content actually helpful for exam preparation
   - **Solution**: Included key terms, essay topics, and study strategies
   - **Learning**: How to design for learning outcomes

### What I Learned
- Designing for different learning styles and devices
- Breaking down a large project into manageable components



## How to Use
1. Navigate between units using the header menu
2. Review key concepts and vocabulary for each unit
3. Use the essay topics for writing practice
4. Study on any device - the site is fully responsive
5. Use the "Close" button to return to the units page
