        <strong>Key Concept:</strong> The arrival of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere and the subsequent Columbian Exchange led to dramatic social, cultural, and political changes in Europe, Africa, and the Americas.

        <h3>General Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diverse:</strong> Societies were incredibly varied, adapting to their environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> Estimates range from 50-100 million people in the Americas.</li>
            <li><strong>No "Single" Story:</strong> They were not a monolithic group; they had different languages, religions, social structures, and economies.</li>

        <h2>2. European Exploration & Colonization: The "Why"</h2>
        
        <h3>Motivating Factors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Desire for gold, silver, and new trade routes to Asia (spices, silk).</li>
            <li><strong>Political Power:</strong> Competition between rising nation-states (Spain, Portugal, England, France).</li>
            <li><strong>Religion:</strong> The spread of Christianity (Catholicism, later Protestantism) and the push to counter Islam.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Advances in navigation (astrolabe, caravel ships, magnetic compass) made long voyages possible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Explorers & Nations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spain:</strong> <strong>Christopher Columbus (1492)</strong> - Sailed for Spain, "discovered" the Americas, beginning sustained contact. <strong>Conquistadors</strong> like Cortés (Aztecs) and Pizarro (Incas) conquered empires.</li>
            <li><strong>England:</strong> <strong>John Cabot (1497)</strong> - Claimed land in North America for England.</li>
            <li><strong>France:</strong> <strong>Jacques Cartier (1530s-40s)</strong> - Explored the St. Lawrence River, claiming Canada.</li>
            <li><strong>Netherlands:</strong> <strong>Henry Hudson (1609)</strong> - Explored the Hudson River, establishing New Netherland.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. The Columbian Exchange</h2>
        <p>The widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World (Europe, Africa, Asia).</p>

        <h3>Consequences:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Devastated Native Populations:</strong> Old World diseases killed up to 90% of indigenous people (known as the <strong>Great Dying</strong>), as they had no immunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformed European Diets:</strong> New foods like potatoes and corn led to population growth in Europe.</li>
            <li><strong>Fueled Capitalism:</strong> Influx of American silver and gold created a global economy and price inflation (the <strong>Price Revolution</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Led to New Labor Systems:</strong> The death of Native Americans and the growth of plantation agriculture led to the <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong>.</li>

        <h2>4. The Spanish Colonial System</h2>
        
        <h3>Methods of Colonization:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Empire of Conquest:</strong> Focused on extracting wealth (gold/silver) and converting natives to Catholicism.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Force:</strong> Superior weapons (guns, steel) and disease allowed them to conquer powerful empires.</li>
            <li><strong>The Encomienda System:</strong> A Spanish labor system where colonists were granted land and the labor of the Native Americans living on it. In return, the colonist was supposed to "protect" and Christianize them. In practice, it was a form of <strong>slavery and brutal exploitation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Caste System:</h3>
        <p>A rigid social hierarchy based on race and place of birth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peninsulares</strong> → Spanish-born</li>
            <li><strong>Creoles</strong> → American-born Spanish</li>
            <li><strong>Mestizos</strong> → Mixed European & Native American ancestry</li>
            <li><strong>Mulattos</strong> → Mixed European & African ancestry</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Resistance & Critique:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pueblo Revolt (1680):</strong> Successful uprising by Pueblo people in modern-day New Mexico against Spanish missionaries and colonists. They drove the Spanish out for over a decade.</li>
            <li><strong>Bartolomé de las Casas:</strong> A Spanish priest who advocated for the rights of Native Americans, arguing against the brutality of the encomienda system. His writings created the <strong>"Black Legend"</strong>—the perception of Spain as uniquely cruel and exploitative.</li>

        <h2>6. The Beginnings of Slavery in the Americas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> The <strong>demand for labor</strong> on sugar plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil, and later tobacco in the English colonies.</li>
            <li><strong>Transition:</strong> The death of Native Americans from disease made them an unreliable labor source. Indentured servitude was time-limited.</li>
            <li><strong>The Shift to African Slavery:</strong> Africans had some immunity to Old World diseases, had no local allies to help them escape, and their skin color made them easily identifiable, facilitating a permanent, hereditary slave system based on race.</li>
            <li><strong>The Slave Trade:</strong> Became a central part of the <strong>Triangular Trade</strong> across the Atlantic.</li>
