    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.1:</strong> The United States became more connected with the world, pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere, and emerged as the destination for many migrants from other countries.
    </div> 

    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.2:</strong> Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.3:</strong> The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested Reconstruction of the South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Themes for Unit 5:</h2>
        <div class="essay-topics">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>American & National Identity:</strong> The crisis over slavery shattered national unity, and the Civil War and Reconstruction redefined what it meant to be an American.</li>
                <li><strong>Politics & Power:</strong> The ultimate failure of political compromise led to war. Reconstruction tested the balance of power between the federal government and the states.</li>
                <li><strong>Work, Exchange, & Technology:</strong> The industrial North vs. the agricultural South. The sharecropping system replaced slavery.</li>
                <li><strong>Culture & Society:</strong> The abolitionist movement, the experience of war, and the struggle for African American rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Migration & Settlement:</strong> Westward expansion fueled the sectional crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>America in the World:</strong> The Union victory strengthened the federal government and influenced other nations' movements against forced labor.</li>
            </ul>
