            <h2>I. The Imperial Crisis (1754-1775)</h2>
            
            <h3>French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) (1754-1763)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Competition over the Ohio River Valley between Britain and France.</li>
                <li><strong>Albany Plan of Union (1754):</strong> Ben Franklin's proposal to create a colonial government for collective security. Rejected but set a precedent for future unity.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> British victory in the Treaty of Paris (1763). France removed from North America.</li>
                <li><strong>Effects:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Colonists:</strong> Gained confidence in their military ability. Felt less need for British protection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Britain:</strong> Massive war debt → new taxes on colonies. Saw colonists as unruly and ungrateful.</li>
                        <li><strong>Native Americans:</strong> Lost a key European ally (France). Pontiac's Rebellion (1763) → Proclamation of 1763, forbidding colonial settlement west of the Appalachians, angering colonists.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Stamp Act (1765):</strong> Direct tax on all paper goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Response:</strong> "No taxation without representation!" Stamp Act Congress (first intercolonial meeting to protest), Sons & Daughters of Liberty, boycotts, violence.</li>
                <li><strong>Repealed in 1766, but Declaratory Act passed, asserting Britain's right to tax.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Townshend Acts (1767):</strong> Taxes on imported goods (lead, glass, paint, tea).</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Response:</strong> Renewed boycotts, smuggling. John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania argued against "external" taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Boston Massacre (1770):</strong> Clash between colonists and British soldiers; used as propaganda.</li>
                <li><strong>Tea Act (1773):</strong> Gave British East India Company a monopoly on tea.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Response:</strong> Boston Tea Party (Sons of Liberty dumped tea into harbor).</li>
                <li><strong>Coercive/Intolerable Acts (1774):</strong> Punishment for Boston Tea Party.</li>
                <li><strong>Closed Boston Harbor, suspended self-government in Massachusetts.</strong></li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shift in Rationale:</strong> Initially fought for "rights as Englishmen," shifted to a movement for independence based on Enlightenment ideals (John Locke's natural rights, social contract).</li>
                <li><strong>Key Documents:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Thomas Paine's Common Sense (1776):</strong> Persuaded ordinary colonists to support independence by arguing monarchy was corrupt and it was "common sense" for America to be free.</li>
                        <li><strong>Declaration of Independence (1776):</strong> Drafted by Thomas Jefferson. Listed grievances against King George III and justified revolution based on Locke's ideas of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>III. The Revolutionary War (1775-1783)</h2>
            
            <h3>Early Phase (1775-1778): Patriots vs. Professional British Army.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>British Advantages:</strong> Strongest navy, professional army, greater resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Advantages:</strong> Fighting on home turf, motivated cause, George Washington's leadership.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Battles:</strong> Lexington & Concord (first), Saratoga (1777) – TURNING POINT – convinced France to ally with the U.S.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Later Phase (1778-1783): A World War.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Franco-American Alliance (1778):</strong> Provided crucial military and financial aid.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Battle:</strong> Yorktown (1781) – American/French force trapped British General Cornwallis, leading to surrender.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Treaty of Paris (1783):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Granted U.S. independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Borders:</strong> Mississippi River to the west, Canada to the north, Florida to the south.</li>
                <li>U.S. promises to repay debts to British merchants and not to persecute Loyalists.</li>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <strong>Key Concept 3.2:</strong> The American Revolution's democratic and republican ideals inspired new experiments with different forms of government.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>I. Impact of the Revolution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Egalitarianism:</strong> Idea of equality spread, challenging old social hierarchies (though incomplete).</li>
                <li><strong>Republican Motherhood:</strong> Idea that women had a vital role in raising virtuous, patriotic citizens. This raised women's status as moral leaders but kept them in the domestic sphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Slavery:</strong> Northern states began gradual emancipation. Southern states strengthened the institution. Contradiction: "All men are created equal" vs. the existence of slavery.</li>
                <li><strong>Native Americans:</strong> Generally lost out. Viewed as enemies who sided with the British. U.S. expansion increased.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>II. The First American Governments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>State Constitutions:</strong> Featured weak executives, strong legislatures, bills of rights, and expanded (but not universal) suffrage.</li>
                <li><strong>Articles of Confederation (1781-1789):</strong> The FIRST U.S. constitution.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> "Firm league of friendship" – very weak central government. Unicameral Congress with no power to tax or regulate trade.</li>
                        <li><strong>Successes:</strong> Won the war, Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (process for admitting new states, banned slavery in NW Territory).</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses & Crises:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Could not tax → government was bankrupt.</li>
                                <li>Could not regulate trade → economic chaos between states.</li>
                                <li>No executive to enforce laws.</li>
                                <li><strong>Shays' Rebellion (1786):</strong> Farmer uprising in Massachusetts over debt. Proved the national government was too weak to maintain order, scaring elites.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <strong>Key Concept 3.3:</strong> Migration within North America and competition over resources, boundaries, and trade intensified conflicts among peoples and nations.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>I. Western Expansion & Conflict</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite the Proclamation of 1763, settlers moved west, leading to constant conflict with Native American tribes.</li>
                <li>The Northwest Ordinance set a pattern for orderly westward expansion but also systematically displaced Native peoples.</li>
                <li>The weak Confederation government struggled to manage these western conflicts or negotiate effectively with Spain & Britain, who held territory on U.S. borders.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <strong>Key Concept 3.4:</strong> The new republic struggled to define and extend democratic ideals in the face of rapid economic, territorial, and demographic changes.

                        <li><strong>Virginia Plan (Large State) vs. New Jersey Plan (Small State)</strong> → Great (Connecticut) Compromise: Bicameral legislature (House by population, Senate equal).</li>
                        <li><strong>3/5 Compromise:</strong> Slaves counted as 3/5 of a person for representation and taxation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Commerce Compromise:</strong> Congress could tax imports but not exports; could regulate interstate and foreign trade.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slave Trade Compromise:</strong> Congress could not ban the slave trade until 1808.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leaders:</strong> Patrick Henry, George Mason.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arguments:</strong> Constitution gave too much power to the central government and lacked a Bill of Rights to protect individual liberties.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> The Federalists promised to add a Bill of Rights to get it ratified.</li>
