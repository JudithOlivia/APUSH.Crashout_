## What is APUSH_Crashout?
APUSH Crashout is a website for AP US History students where it there is notes for all 9 units of the APUSH syllabus.

## Why I Made This Project
A lot of my friends struggle with this course and as someone who has taken this course previously and wants to help them, I find it overwealming to teach every single one of my friends about the topics and repeat myself 6 to 7 times. I initially made a google document with all the info but my friend recommended that I make a website out of it and I did.

## How I Made This Project
I used HTML and CSS

### Challenges
1)
Problem: making the timeline
Solution: I used youtube videos to figure it ouut. 

3)
Problem: making the notes for each units.
Solution: I highlighted each one of my notes from my APUSH classes.
