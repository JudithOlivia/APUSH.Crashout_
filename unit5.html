    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.1:</strong> The United States became more connected with the world, pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere, and emerged as the destination for many migrants from other countries.
    </div> 
    <div class="section">
        <h2>I. Manifest Destiny & Westward Expansion</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manifest Destiny:</strong> The belief that it was America's God-given right and duty to expand across the continent.</li>
            <li><strong>Oregon Trail:</strong> Mass migration of settlers to the Oregon Territory for fertile land.</li>
            <li><strong>Annexation of Texas (1845):</strong> After the Texas Revolution (1836), the U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas, leading to increased tensions with Mexico.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>II. The Mexican-American War (1846-1848)</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Border dispute (Rio Grande vs. Nueces River), U.S. desire for California, and the annexation of Texas.</li>
            <li><strong>Opposition:</strong> Whigs (like Abraham Lincoln) and abolitionists saw it as an unjust war to expand slavery.</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> U.S. victory. Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo gave U.S. the Mexican Cession (CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO).</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Reopened the fierce debate over the expansion of slavery into new territories, directly leading to the Compromise of 1850.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>III. Immigration</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Old Immigration" (1840s-1850s):</strong> Mostly from Northern and Western Europe (Ireland and Germany).</li>
            <li><strong>Irish:</strong> Fleeing the Potato Famine; mostly Catholic; settled in Eastern cities; faced strong nativist prejudice.</li>
            <li><strong>Germans:</strong> Settled in the Midwest; more diverse professions.</li>
            <li><strong>Nativist Response:</strong> Know-Nothing Party emerged, advocating for restrictions on immigration and citizenship.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.2:</strong> Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>I. The Failure of Compromise</h2>
            
        <h3>Compromise of 1850:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>California admitted as a free state.</li>
            <li>Stronger Fugitive Slave Law (enraged Northerners).</li>
            <li>Popular Sovereignty in Utah and New Mexico territories.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed by Stephen A. Douglas.</li>
            <li>Repealed the Missouri Compromise.</li>
            <li>Allowed popular sovereignty in Kansas and Nebraska territories.</li>
            <li>Led to "Bleeding Kansas" – a violent civil war between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Supreme Court ruled that African Americans were not citizens and had no rights.</li>
            <li>Declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional (Congress could not ban slavery in territories).</li>
            <li>Opened all territories to slavery, outraging the North.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>II. The Road to Secession</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rise of the Republican Party:</strong> Founded in 1854 in opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories.</li>
            <li><strong>Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1858):</strong> Lincoln argued against the expansion of slavery, raising his national profile.</li>
            <li><strong>John Brown's Raid (1859):</strong> Failed attempt to start a slave rebellion at Harper's Ferry. Brown became a martyr for the abolitionist cause and a symbol of terror for the South.</li>
            <li><strong>Election of 1860:</strong> Abraham Lincoln (Republican) won without a single Southern electoral vote.</li>
            <li><strong>Secession:</strong> South Carolina seceded first (Dec. 1860), followed by 10 other Southern states, forming the Confederate States of America.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <strong>Key Concept 5.3:</strong> The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested Reconstruction of the South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>I. The Civil War (1861-1865)</h2>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Union Advantages:</strong> Larger population, industrial capacity, railroads, navy.</li>
            <li><strong>Confederate Advantages:</strong> Defensive war on home territory, superior military leadership initially.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Turning Points:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emancipation Proclamation (1863):</strong> Changed the war's purpose to include abolishing slavery. Kept Europe from aiding the Confederacy and allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union Army.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gettysburg (July 1863) & Vicksburg (July 1863):</strong> Dual turning points; crippled the Confederate war effort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lincoln's Leadership:</strong> Gettysburg Address redefined the war as a struggle for a "new birth of freedom" and democracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>II. Reconstruction (1865-1877)</h2>
            
        <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong> How to reunite the nation? What is the status of freed African Americans?</p>
            
        <h3>Presidential vs. Congressional Reconstruction:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lincoln/Johnson (10% Plan):</strong> Lenient; quick restoration of Southern states.</li>
            <li><strong>Radical Republicans:</strong> Wanted to punish the South and protect African American rights.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Key Policies & Amendments:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freedmen's Bureau:</strong> Provided aid, education, and legal help to freed slaves.</li>
            <li><strong>13th Amendment (1865):</strong> Abolished slavery.</li>
            <li><strong>14th Amendment (1868):</strong> Granted citizenship and "equal protection under the law" to all persons born in the U.S.</li>
            <li><strong>15th Amendment (1870):</strong> Prohibited denying the right to vote based on race.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Southern Resistance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black Codes:</strong> Laws restricting the freedom of African Americans.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharecropping:</strong> Economic system that kept freedpeople in a cycle of debt and poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Ku Klux Klan:</strong> Terrorist organization that used violence to intimidate African Americans and their white allies.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>The End of Reconstruction:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compromise of 1877:</strong> Political deal that gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in exchange for removing federal troops from the South.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Ended Reconstruction. Southern "Redeemer" governments took over and instituted Jim Crow laws, effectively ending the political and social gains of African Americans.</li>
        </ul>
