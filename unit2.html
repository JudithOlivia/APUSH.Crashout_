        <div class="key-concept">
            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Patterns of European colonization, developing colonial societies and identities, and the Transatlantic world.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.1</h2>
            <p>Europeans developed a variety of colonization and migration patterns, influenced by different imperial goals, cultures, and the varied North American environments where they settled, and they competed with each other and American Indians for resources.</p>
            
            <h3>I. Spanish Colonization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Extract wealth (gold, silver), convert Natives to Christianity (Catholicism).</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Established a rigid caste system, used encomienda and hacienda systems for labor.</li>
                <li><strong>Regions:</strong> Florida, New Mexico, Texas, California.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Example:</strong> The Pueblo Revolt (1680) led by Popé. A successful, coordinated uprising of Pueblo people against Spanish colonizers, driving them out of present-day New Mexico for over a decade. It demonstrated the effectiveness of Native American resistance and led to slightly more tolerant Spanish policies upon their return.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>II. French & Dutch Colonization</h3>
            <p><strong>French:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Fur trade and missionary work (Jesuits).</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Built trading posts (e.g., Quebec, New Orleans). Relatively few settlers, so they developed largely cooperative relationships with Native tribes (e.g., Algonquians, Huron) for mutual economic benefit.</li>
                <li><strong>Relations with Natives:</strong> Based on trade and alliance, though they were drawn into Native conflicts (e.g., with the Iroquois Confederacy).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dutch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Commercial enterprise and trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Established New Netherland with its capital at New Amsterdam (later NYC).</li>
                <li><strong>Relations with Natives:</strong> Initially friendly with the Iroquois for the fur trade, but conflict arose over land (e.g., Kieft's War). Known for being relatively tolerant.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>III. English Colonization - The Three Models</h3>
            <p>England established distinct colonies based on different motivations.</p>
            
            <h3>A. The Chesapeake (Virginia & Maryland)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Economic profit (Joint-Stock Company - Virginia Company).</li>
                <li><strong>Society:</strong> Dominated by wealthy tobacco planters. Initially relied on indentured servants (young men who exchanged labor for passage to America).</li>
                <li><strong>Key Events:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Jamestown (1607):</strong> First permanent English colony. "Starving Time" highlighted poor planning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Headright System:</strong> Offered 50 acres of land to anyone who paid for their own or another's passage. Encouraged immigration and cemented the land-owning elite.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bacon's Rebellion (1676):</strong> Armed rebellion of former indentured servants and some enslaved Africans against Governor Berkeley's friendly policies toward Natives. Significance: Exposed class tensions and the planter elite's fear of a large, landless, white underclass. Led to a shift from indentured servitude to racial chattel slavery as the primary labor source.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>B. New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Religious freedom for Puritans (who wanted to "purify" the Church of England). They were Separatists (Pilgrims) who wanted to separate entirely.</li>
                <li><strong>Society:</strong> Family-centered, tight-knit religious communities. "City upon a hill" ideology (John Winthrop) – the idea that their society would be a model for the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Events/Figures:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mayflower Compact (1620):</strong> Early form of self-government and social contract.</li>
                        <li><strong>Anne Hutchinson & Roger Williams:</strong> Challenged Puritan orthodoxy. Williams founded Rhode Island on the principle of religious tolerance and separation of church and state.</li>
                        <li><strong>King Philip's War (1675-1676):</strong> Metacom's (King Philip's) alliance of Native tribes vs. New England colonists. A devastating conflict that ended most Native American power in the region.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>C. The Middle Colonies (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Economically diverse ("breadbasket colonies"), ethnically and religiously diverse, more social tolerance and democratic.</li>
                <li><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Founded by William Penn as a "Holy Experiment" for Quakers. Featured representative assembly, religious freedom, and relatively peaceful relations with Natives.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.2</h2>
            <p>The British colonies participated in political, social, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain that encouraged both stronger bonds with Britain and resistance to Britain's control.</p>
            
            <h3>I. The Transatlantic Trade & Mercantilism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mercantilism:</strong> Economic theory that colonies exist to benefit the mother country by providing raw materials and a market for finished goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation Acts (1651-1673):</strong> Series of laws passed by Parliament to enforce mercantilism.
                    <ul>
                        <li>All trade must be on English/colonial ships.</li>
                        <li>Enumerated goods (like tobacco, sugar) could only be sold to England.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Benefitted some colonial merchants and shipbuilders (especially in New England), but restricted the economic freedom of Southern planters. Led to widespread smuggling.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>II. The Institution of Slavery</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> The need for a reliable, controllable, and permanent labor force after Bacon's Rebellion and the rise of cash crops (tobacco, rice, indigo).</li>
                <li><strong>Development of Chattel Slavery:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1640s: First legal sanctions against slavery appear in Virginia and Maryland.</li>
                        <li>1660s-1700s: "Slave Codes" are passed, legally defining enslaved Africans as property for life, and making slavery a hereditary status based on the mother.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stono Rebellion (1739):</strong> A slave rebellion in South Carolina. It led to the harsher Negro Act of 1740, which restricted slaves' education, movement, and assembly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>III. Cultural & Intellectual Developments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Enlightenment:</strong> Emphasized reason, science, and individual rights (John Locke's natural rights). Influenced colonial thinkers like Benjamin Franklin.</li>
                <li><strong>The First Great Awakening (1730s-1740s):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A religious revival that reacted against the cold, intellectual Puritanism and Enlightenment rationalism.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key Preachers:</strong> Jonathan Edwards ("Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God") and George Whitefield (itinerant preacher who drew huge crowds).</li>
                        <li><strong>Impacts:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Challenged established religious and political authority.</li>
                                <li>Emphasized individual faith and emotionalism.</li>
                                <li>Increased religious diversity and competition among denominations.</li>
                                <li>Created a shared experience across the colonies, fostering a sense of American identity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2.3</h2>
            <p>Competition over resources between European rivals and American Indians encouraged industry and trade and led to conflict in the Americas.</p>
            
            <h3>I. Patterns of Conflict & Interaction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trade:</strong> The fur trade was the primary initial economic interaction, creating interdependence but also competition and warfare among tribes.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease:</strong> Epidemics of smallpox, measles, etc., decimated Native populations (up to 90% in some areas), making them more vulnerable to European encroachment.</li>
                <li><strong>Diplomacy & War:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Beaver Wars (mid-1600s):</strong> Iroquois, armed by Dutch and English, fought against French-backed Huron and other tribes for control of the fur trade.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pequot War (1636-1638):</strong> New England colonists vs. the Pequot tribe. Ended with the near-destruction of the Pequot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Metis:</strong> People of mixed French and Native American ancestry, often served as cultural and economic intermediaries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>II. A Shifting Balance of Power</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By 1750, the population and economic power of the British colonies were growing exponentially, while Native American power was declining due to disease, warfare, and loss of land.</li>
                <li>European rivalries (Britain vs. France) increasingly dictated the nature of alliances and conflicts in North America, setting the stage for a major imperial conflict.</li>
            </ul>
